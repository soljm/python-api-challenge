# Python API Challenge
From Module 6: Python APIs from the Data Analytics Boot Camp by Monash University and EdX.

By implementing skills learnt throughout the module, an attempt at the challenge has been submitted here.

## Contents
- **WeatherPy** folder with 2 `.ipynb` files
- **output_data** folder with `.csv` files and 4 figures 
- `.gitignore` file 

## Explanation
A majority of the codes where given in the starter code.

### WeatherPy
Function was created for the linear regression due to repitition. Decided to implement customisation of labels in the function as well to avoid more repitition and keep the code concise.

### VacationPy
Results after filtering were kept to 11 to avoid having too much data and keeping it concise.

## Credits
Credits to my friend, NT, who helped me troubleshoot the code in Step 4 of VacationPy as no hotels were being found despite adjusting to a bigger sample size.
